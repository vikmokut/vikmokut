Hi, i'm Victor Mokut.

* 👷🏽‍♂️ I have tinkered with several languages and computing fields to sooth my curiosity.
* 🎓 I am currently studying computer science.
* 📚 I am currently learning Golang.
* 🧘🏽‍♂️ Hmmm, social media - really, there is too much good information there it's distracting, so no accounts for now.
