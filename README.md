## Welcome to my World

👋 Hello there, I’m @vikmokut (Victor Mokut)

Learn a bit about my big dreams from this brief readme.

- I am a professional Health Information Administrator.
- I Seek to implement and leverage information technology to enhance proper medical records management and promote reliable clinical and healthcare data for research and medical advancements.
- To build a robust digital Healthcare system that will make health care in Africa affordable, accessible and progressive (clinical research).
- The healthcare industry in Africa particularly, swims in a huge well of neglected, under utilized and untapped or under tapped  data. I believe that there's great prospect in these resources to advance healthcare in many ways. This is what my journey is about and I am living daily to unravel these possibilities with any opportunity I get.
- 👀 I have a strong interest in Data Science and the application of machine learning and AI in healthcare.
